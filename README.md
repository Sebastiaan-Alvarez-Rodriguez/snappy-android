## FAQ

### How to get a personal access token?
See github's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry#using-a-published-package).

### Why would I need a personal access token, or even a github account, to download a *public* package?
Beats me,
